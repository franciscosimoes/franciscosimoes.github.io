I am an adjuct professor at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE), Brazil. I am also a research leader at Voxar Labs/CIn-UFPE, and the vice-president of the special committee on virtual reality (CE-RV) of the Brazilian Computing Society (SBC).


My research focuses on Spatial Intelligence. More exactly, I use Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning techniques to better understand a space to allow sensing or interaction with it. Multiple research questions arise from this goal: How can we reduce (or remove) the need for real training data in real world applications as 6DoF pose estimation? How can we improve the accuracy while exploring multiple cues/information as for 3D printed objects? How can we make CV in a privacy-preserving manner?
