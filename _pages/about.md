I am an adjuct professor at Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco (UFRPE), Brazil. I am also a researcher at Voxar Labs/CIn-UFPE, and the vice-president of the special committee on virtual reality (CE-RV) of the Brazilian Computing Society (SBC).


My research focuses on Spatial Intelligence. I use computer vision (CV) and deep learning techniques to better understand a space to allow both sensing (e.g. visual inspection, pedestrian detection) and interaction (e.g. virtual and augmented reality, 3D printing, metaverse applications). Multiple research questions arise from this goal: How can we reduce (or remove) the need for real training data in real world vision applications? How can we improve the accuracy of methods by exploring multiple cues/information? How can we make CV in a privacy-preserving context?
